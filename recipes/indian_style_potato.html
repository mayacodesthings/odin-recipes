        <li>Salt to taste [I have added total 1Teaspoon pink Himalayan salt (1/4 on onion + 3/4 teaspoon on potatoes)]</li>
        <li>1/4 cup / 3 Tablespoon Water</li>
        <li>70g / 1/2 cup Frozen Green Peas</li>
        <li>(Frozen peas are flash-steamed before they're frozen, so they're already ready to eat and just needs to be warmed up quickly so they maintain their slight bounce and bright colour)</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Lime or Lemon juice to taste (I have added 1 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup / 15g Cilantro (Coriander leaves) - chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Ground black pepper or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>‚ñ∂Ô∏è METHOD:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with 2 to 3 inches of water and bring it to a boil. In the mean time, peel, wash and chop the potatoes (1 inch X 1 Inch pieces ) and place the chopped potatoes in the steamer basket. Steam for 12 to 15 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked and fork tender. Once steamed set it aside for later. It took me 13 minutes on my stove. <b>üëâ ‚úÖ Cooking time of the potatoes depends on it's quality, some batches of potatoes may take longer to cook. SO ADJUST THE COOKING TIME ACCORDINGLY</b></li>
        <li>To a heated pan add the cooking oil, onion and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Adding salt to onion will release it's moisture and help it cook faster, so please don‚Äôt skip this step. Fry on medium to medium-high heat until the onion starts to brown. It takes about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped garlic and ginger and fry for 1 to 2 minutes on medium heat or until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and spices (Turmeric, Paprika, Ground Cumin, Ground Coriander, Cayenne Pepper) and mix well. Fry for a few seconds and then add the green peas and water. Fry on medium heat until the water is cooked out. Now add the steamed potatoes and salt. Mix thoroughly until the potatoes are coated with the spices and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes. Break half of the potatoes with your spatula. Turn off the stove.</li>
        <li>
            Garnish with freshly ground black pepper, cilantro (coriander leaves), lime or lemon juice. Mix well and serve as a side dish, in a wrap or sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
