    <h3>‚ñ∂Ô∏è METHOD:</h3>
    <b>üëâ COOK THIS DISH IN A WIDER PAN, this will prevent the rice from getting soggy.</b>
    <ol>
        <li>THOROUGHLY WASH THE RICE until the water runs clear, to get rid of any impurities/gunk (it's an important step so do not skip it) and then soak for 20 minutes only.</li>
        <li>
            To a heated pan, add cooking oil, onion, green bell pepper and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Fry on medium to medium-high heat (depending on the heat of your stove) until it‚Äôs lightly browned. It will take about 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the green onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, ground cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper and mix well. Fry on medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes to cook out the raw flavour of the ingredients added and fry until fragrant. </li>
        <li>Now add the rice, salt and vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover and cook for about 10 minutes or until the rice is cooked (DO NOT LET THE RICE GET MUSHY). While the rice is cooking, drain and thoroughly rinse the cooked white beans with water and let it sit in a strainer for any excess water to drain. WE DO NOT WANT SOGGY BEANS for this recipe.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes of the rice cooking, uncover the pan. Let it cook UNCOVERED on low heat for another 1 minute. THIS WILL GET RID OF ANY EXCESS MOISTURE AND PREVENT THE RICE FROM GETTING SOGGY.</li>
        <li>
            Turn off the heat. Add the cooked bean, cilantro, lime juice, black pepper, extra virgin olive oil to the hot rice and mix. Mix very gently to prevent the rice grains from breaking. DO NOT OVER MIX THE RICE because the rice grains are very soft and can turn into mush. Serve hot with your favourite side and a green salad.</li>
    </ol>
