        <b>‚úÖ üëâ DO NOT ADD ANY MORE THAN 140G OF TOMATOES BECAUSE WE ARE ADDING THE TOMATO PASTE TOO.</b>
        <li>1/4 Cup / 60ml Water or as required</li>
        <li>Salt to taste (I added total 1 teaspoon of pink Himalayan salt (1/4 tsp while frying the onions + 3/4 tsp to the chickpeas))</li>
        <li>1/4 Teaspoon Sugar (I have used cane sugar)</li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon Garam Masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>üëâ GARNISH:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 Cup / 10g Coriander leaves (Cilantro) - finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Extra virgin Olive Oil or Vegan butter</li>
        <b>OPTIONAL GARNISH: Lemon juice to taste  ‚úÖ üëâ ONLY IF NEEDED - TASTE THE CHICKPEA CURRY BEFORE ADDING THE LEMON JUICE AND ADD ONLY IF NEEDED.</b>
    </ul>
    <h3>‚ñ∂Ô∏è METHOD:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pan and add olive oil to it. Add the finely chopped onion and 1/4 Tsp salt. Fry on medium heat until the onions are golden brown. It will take about 7 minutes or so. Adding salt while frying the onions will release it's moisture and help it cook faster so please don‚Äôt skip it.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped garlic and ginger and fry on medium to medium-low heat for 1 to 2 minute or until fragrant. NOW REDUCE THE HEAT TO LOW BEFORE ADDING THE SPICES (this will prevent the spices from burning). Add the tomato paste, ground cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, ground black pepper, cayenne pepper and fry in low heat for 2 minutes or so. Add the chopped tomatoes. Now increase the heat to medium. Fry on medium to medium-high heat until the spices and tomatoes forms a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chickpeas along with the chickpea cooking liquid (aquafaba), 1/4 cup water, salt, sugar, garam masala and mix well. Turn up the heat and bring to a boil. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Then remove the lid of the pan. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook the chickpeas for another 1 to 2 minutes or until the gravy reaches the consistency you desire. Turn off the stove. Garnish with cilantro, olive oil or vegan butter and lime/lemon juice. Mix well. Cover the lid and allow it rest for 2 to 3 mins. Serve hot with rice, naan, roti or pita and green side salad. </li>
        <b>‚úÖ üëâ PLEASE NOTE:  THIS CURRY HAS A THICKER CONSISTENCY AND IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE WATERY.</b>
